                    <p>Introduction 
                        About Tesla: 
                        Tesla, Inc. earlier known as Tesla Motors specializes in electric cars, Lithium-ion battery 
                        for energy  storage, and residential solar panels  through their solar  city subsidiary.  Elon 
                        Musk, JB Straubel, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, and Ian Wright founded Tesla on July 1, 
                        2003  and  Elon  Musk  is  currently  Tesla’s  Chairman,  Product  Architect  and  CEO.  Tesla  is 
                        headquartered  in  Palo  Alto,  California  with  more  than  30,000  employees  and  212  stores 
                        worldwide with many more on the way. Tesla went public in June 2010 and generated over 
                        $226 million in its IPO.  
                        In 2008, Tesla released its first electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, and sold over 2,100 of them 
                        in 32  countries. Tesla modeled the Roadster  after the  Lotus Elise by  securing a contract  with 
                        Lotus for 2,500 Elise Gliders. 
                        In  the  fall  of  2012  Tesla  released  the  Model  S,  the  first  fully  electric,  luxury,  high 
                        performance  sedan.  In  March 2009,  a  prototype  of  the  Model  S  was  released  at  a  public 
                        exhibition. It was met with great reviews and received over 8000 pre-orders for the vehicle. With 
                        significantly greater  manufacturing capabilities and  a price  tag less  than half  that of  the first 
                        electric sports car Roadster, the Model S penetrated a larger share of the market in 2013. 
                        In 2012, when Tesla was about to launch the Model S, they clearly stated their mission to be “a 
                        clean start, committed to electric built around the driver, and sparking the evolution” the 
                        same  as  it  is  today.  Its  aim  was  to  constantly  innovate  and  deliver  the  most  efficient  and 
                        sustainable electric cars. Later Tesla segmented their business into Electric car and other green 
                        energy empowered subsidiaries. 
                        In this study we are analyzing the journey of effectively segmented, accurately targeted and well 
                        positioned Tesla Model S electric car through various key concepts of Principles of Marketing. 
                        The Product: TESLA Model S 
                        The goal of Tesla’s engineers was to produce the best high performance luxury sedan on the 
                        market,  regardless  of  its  electric  capabilities.  Tesla  proudly  states  this  is  something  it  has 
                        achieved.  The  Model  S  is  composed  of  a  perfect  blend  between  “exceptional  performance, 
                        functionality, and attractive styling. “With a rigid body structure, nearly 50/50 weight distribution 
                        and a remarkably low center of gravity, Model S offers the responsiveness and agility expected 
                        from  world’s  best  sports  cars  while  providing  the  ride  quality of  a  sedan”.  AMAZINGLY, its 
                        performance model can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. In addition to its superior 
                        driving  capabilities,  the Model  S  offers a  number of  revolutionary  luxury features.  It comes 
                        standard  with  a  17  inch  touchscreen  that  features  integrated  maps,  music,  and  high  speed 
                        connectivity to the internet, which  is superior to  offerings in its  class. It’s the only  sedan  that 
                        offers an all glass panoramic roof of which can be completely opened by a touch of a button. The 
                        Model S also has the best in class storage space at 36.8 cubic feet. 
                        With  its performance  driving and  luxury  features,  it is  hard  to believe  the  Model S  is  fully 
                        electric. Criticisms of  other  electric  cars on the market are  that  they  aren’t capable of traveling 
                        long distances on one charge, or that they take too long to fully charge. The Model S offered 
                         
                         
                        2 
                        Tesla, Inc. 
                        12-May-2017 
                        three battery pack options, 40kWH, 50kWH, and 85kWH, with a range of 160 miles, 230 
                        miles,  and  300 miles  respectively,  on  a single charge.  Using  any  normal  outlet it  can  be 
                        recharged at a  rate of 62  miles per hour,  and with a Tesla Supercharger, in thirty minute, the 
                        vehicle can be charged to 50 percent capacity. Both the charge time and distance travelled per 
                        charge far exceed that of its competitors. Without the need for gasoline, Tesla estimates that the 
                        Model S will save consumers who drive comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans 
                        approximately $1,900 a year.  
                        Beyond  the performance,  styling  and energy  efficiency  of the  Model  S, there  are  additional 
                        benefits that bring value to the consumer. One of these is the exceptional customer service and 
                        support that comes with being a Tesla owner. Even though the company expected “the Model S 
                        will have lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans 
                        due to few moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark 
                        plugs, and engine valves”, if customer’s Model S requires service, a Tesla technician will come to 
                        customer’s home to make the necessary repairs. The battery also came with an 8 year 100 mile 
                        warranty. There are also a number of intangible benefits to being a Tesla owner. The Model S had 
                        been designed to ensure a 5 star safety rating, giving its drivers and their families’ piece of mind. 
                        There is also the positive feeling the owner receives for being the driver of a zero emissions car.  
                        Tesla said, “We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and 
                        energy  efficiency  of  Model  S  will  help  position  it  as  a  compelling  alternative  to  other 
                        vehicles in the luxury and performance segment.” 
                        Market Analysis before launch of Tesla Model S: 
                        The market segment that was targeted had been identified as primarily males ages 25-60. 
                        They tended  to have good jobs, are at  a comfortable stage  in their lives, and  have an annual 
                        household income of $100,000  or more. They live in urban or urban fringe areas. Some of 
                        them can have up to 2 hour commutes to work and want a luxury vehicle to make the long </p>
